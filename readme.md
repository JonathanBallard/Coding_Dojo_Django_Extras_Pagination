# AJAX & jQuery Pagination

## TODO

- When users create enough leads in one go to require a new pagination page, automatically create it without having to refresh
- Pretty it up more
- On creation of a new Lead, automatically send user to the page where it exists and maybe mark it (?)
- Gray out the pagination page you're currently on
- **DONE** Add little left and right arrows!
- Add in Font Awesome Icons for left and right arrows!
- Pagination numbers should change based on where we are!
- Add an ellipsis and a link to the last page in the pagination
- Add basic validators for the Lead
- Show only the 2 pages on either side of current page and show the first and last page of the pagination as well
- Add a bunch more fake users and delete all real people in the database
